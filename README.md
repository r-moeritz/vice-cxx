Vice++
======

Code to follow along with the
[Programming a Chess Engine in C](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg)
series of video tutorials on YouTube.

Most of the code was typed out verbatim while pausing the videos, with changes
made afterward whenever I felt the urge. One notable difference between my code
and that presented in the videos is that I'm using C++ instead of C and have
tried to mould the code to conform to modern C++ style; hence the new name,
Vice++.
